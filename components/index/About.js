                                and how to solve and address the different problems that I encountered. At the same time I was 
                                studying, I took multiple courses on my own, such as: master in JavaScript, React Js, React Native, 
                                React advanced: Next Js, GraphQL, Apollo, Tailwind, React Hooks, Oracle, Unity. In addition to doing 
                                the aforementioned, I also made a couple of websites for some SMEs.
